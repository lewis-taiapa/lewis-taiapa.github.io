                <p><span id="techblog">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span> </p>
                <p>My Long term to goal is to build a career as software engineer, learn to invest wisely so I can retire as early as possible, and one day use my skills to help those in need. I don’t know what that looks like exactly but I do know that software engineering and web-development are areas I believe I can be good at and enjoy!</p>

                <p><span id="techblog">How will you comit to managing yourself to work productively and safely?</span> </p>
                <ul class="marging-properties-smtxt">
                    <li>I have a planned structure that I have printed out next to me to keep myself on task and organised each day. To be productive I will focus mainly on three things, 1. First have a plan  prepared at the beginning of the day or prepared the night before on how I intend to execute my day. The plan is clear and has time slots allocated to specifically chosen tasks that are to be completed that day. I know that if I don’t have this structure in place and try to wing it, I get less done and can easily loose sight on is important to focus on and how much time I am spending on it if it is too much or not enough etc.</li>
                    <li>Discipline and Focus are important to maintain for me as well. For me, understanding and having a WHY is what will keep me on task. If I get distracted or something grabs my attention I need to ask myself is important or do I need to focus and get back on track? Ask myself why am I here? Are my goals more important then that distraction? ABSOLUTELY!!!! </li>
                    <li>If things get tough and they start to build up, I have my facilitator to talk to, also have other support as well. If I am stuck on something or just need to get my mind of things to refresh, I like to go out to nature for walks and breathe some fresh air, do some exercise and then come back to the problem again with fresh eyes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span id="techblog">How will you seek help in a timely manner?</span> </p>
                <p>So far, I have been leasing with my course Facilitator and she has been great with any issues so far. This works for me so will stick to this approach unless I need to do something different.</p>
                <p><span id="techblog">What are my expectations for the Facilitation team?</span> </p>
                <p>I think it is important for them to provide the guidance and support that is needed to help students get through the course. And also provide a push every now and then if they can see we have more to give.</p>
