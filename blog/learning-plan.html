                <h3>My Learning Plan - Bootcamp:</h3>
                <p><span id="techblog">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span> </p>
                <p>
                    To become a Software Engineer, Investor, Retired! The skills I am hoping to develop whilst at this course are those of practice programming and problem solving and also some self awareness and core EQ skills to use for work/day-today life. I am not sure yet as to what Impact I would like to make once I leave here but hopefully something in a positive way to the world. Destination is retirement! Financial freedom.

                <p><span id="techblog">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</span> </p>
                <p>
                    I think it will be keeping up with the speed of teaching and learning. So far in foundations I have been working at my own pace, and based on the allocated time slots am finding that I will go over the recommended times, not so much for the tech work, but more so for the core material! My Strengths will be in the practical tasks, I have been very quick to build the games and programs during foundations and think that will be my main strength.
                </p> 

                <p><span id="techblog">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</span> </p>
                <p>
                    Possibly getting used to working and learning when people are around, it might be overwhelming having others there learning at the same time and may be hard to focus. So far in Foundations I have been working alone and undisturbed/quiet. Adding people to the mix will be interesting. And I would like to be able to develop self awareness to be able to work productively even in a crowded environment with many distractions.

                <p>
                    I would like to work on developing self awareness and reflective skills whilst I am here at Dev Academy.

                <p><span id="techblog">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</span> </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to have some access to a bootcamp facilitator to check in with like what we had during Foundations, this is mainly to get some clarity or understanding on something if it is unclear. So far that support system via direct messaging and calling slack has been really good! Having this at bootcamp would be great.
                </p> 

                <p><span id="techblog">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</span> </p>
                <p>
                    Based on my knowledge of Bootcamp, I will try to seek help via a weekly catchup call if that is available with a facilitator. I am still unsure how the days will look during bootcamp, but will endeavour to plan and set daily goals to get the most learning and work completed out of everyday. Ultimately these short term goals will give me an indication as to where I am, if I am falling behind or on top of things. Then Reflection at the end of everyday to see what worked and what didn’t and make adjustments accordingly. All of these structures are put into place to reach the Ultimate goal of graduating ready and capable for the work force!

                <p><span id="techblog">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span> </p>
                <p>My Long term to goal is to build a career as software engineer, learn to invest wisely so I can retire as early as possible, and one day use my skills to help those in need. I don’t know what that looks like exactly but I do know that software engineering and web-development are areas I believe I can be good at and enjoy!</p>

                    <li>I like to do things in order and not skip important parts. I understand the importance of getting the basics right before moving on to more complicated things.</li>

                    <li>Plan out my day so that I am organized and have direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Limitations:</p>
                <ul class="marging-properties-smtxt">
                    <li>Can get distracted sometimes, either from people, devices, or floating thoughts.</li>
                    <li>Taking to long to complete tasks. Slow paced learning and/or distractions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span id="techblog">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span> </p>
                <ol class="marging-properties-smtxt">
                    <li>Better learning capability and developed learning strageties that work best for me.</li>
                    <li>Better time management skills.</li>

                    <li>Better problem solving skills.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><span id="techblog">How will you comit to managing yourself to work productively and safely?</span> </p>
                <ul class="marging-properties-smtxt">
                    <li>I have a planned structure that I have printed out next to me to keep myself on task and organised each day. To be productive I will focus mainly on three things, 1. First have a plan  prepared at the beginning of the day or prepared the night before on how I intend to execute my day. The plan is clear and has time slots allocated to specifically chosen tasks that are to be completed that day. I know that if I don’t have this structure in place and try to wing it, I get less done and can easily loose sight on is important to focus on and how much time I am spending on it if it is too much or not enough etc.</li>
                    <li>Discipline and Focus are important to maintain for me as well. For me, understanding and having a WHY is what will keep me on task. If I get distracted or something grabs my attention I need to ask myself is important or do I need to focus and get back on track? Ask myself why am I here? Are my goals more important then that distraction? ABSOLUTELY!!!! </li>
                    <li>If things get tough and they start to build up, I have my facilitator to talk to, also have other support as well. If I am stuck on something or just need to get my mind of things to refresh, I like to go out to nature for walks and breathe some fresh air, do some exercise and then come back to the problem again with fresh eyes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span id="techblog">How will you seek help in a timely manner?</span> </p>
                <p>So far, I have been leasing with my course Facilitator and she has been great with any issues so far. This works for me so will stick to this approach unless I need to do something different.</p>
                <p><span id="techblog">What are my expectations for the Facilitation team?</span> </p>
                <p>I think it is important for them to provide the guidance and support that is needed to help students get through the course. And also provide a push every now and then if they can see we have more to give.</p>
