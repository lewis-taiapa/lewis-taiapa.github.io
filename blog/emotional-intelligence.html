                <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
                <p>Emotional intelligence (also known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Having a good level of Emotional Intelligence can help you to build relationships that are stronger, give you a better headspace to succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also allow you to connect with your internal feelings, turn your intentions into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.</p>

                <p>As described by <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/emotional-intelligence-eq.htm">Helpguide.org</a>, Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:</p>

                <ul id="regular-size-font">
                    <li><span id="techblog">Self-management</span> - You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviours, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
                    <li><span id="techblog">Self-awareness</span> - You recognise your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behaviour. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</li>
                    <li><span id="techblog">Social-awareness</span> - You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognise the power of dynamics in a group organization.</li>
                    <li><span id="techblog">Relationship management</span> - You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
                <p>IQ or Intelligence quotient, is a score an individual gets when completing one of many standardised tests to asses their level of intelligence. It differs from EQ because it focuses more measuring an individuals academic abilities where as EQ is a better indicator for measuring ones ability to manage, control, and express their emotions. While IQ is a great indicator for knowledge and skill capability, EQ is a better indicator for an individuals success in the workplace especially in team environments because of their ability to understand, empathise, and connect with the people around them.</p>

                        <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
                        <p>As you may see around you, it is not always the smartest people who are the most successful or fulfilled in life. There are times where an individual may have a high IQ and be academically smart but lack in social environments, struggle working in teams, and/or in their personal relationships. IQ on it’s own is not enough to achieve success in life. Your IQ will help you to understand and learn new skills/concepts for school and work, but it is your EQ that will help you to manage the stress and emotions when applying for and working in your jobs. Both are just as important as the the other, but working in tandem they can help you to achieve the goals that you want in life more effectively. Here are the four key aspects that Emotional intelligence affects in your life (as described by <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/emotional-intelligence-eq.htm">helpguide.org):</a></p>
