                <h3>Foundations Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my week 5 reflection blog, in this blog I will reflect on the 5 weeks we have spent on this learning process and share some insights on how the Core Material and Self-Awareness topics have influenced my learning and skills development.
                    </p>

                <h5>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h5>
                    <p>
                        I have definitely found that managing time on tasks was a big discovery for me, I could see myself getting distracted away from the task at hand either from an outside source, by branching off and learning things off topic, or spending too much time on one task. I had to do a lot of self reflection to better manage this and have a process that is still being fine tuned to make sure I better manage my time. I am easily distracted, whether it be socially, thoughts, or from things that need urgent attention, again another work in progress but having that awareness and applying some of the strategies from the core learning has helped. I think distraction also has taught me a lot about focus, how to best be present so that all of your attention is put towards that one task that needs to be done.
                    </p>
                    
                <h5>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
                   <p>
                        The role of values, empathy and self awareness in the learning process and in programming helps to give yourself the best chance of learning effectively, solving problems more efficiently and being able to work well in a team or with others. Values keep you grounded and sets a clear and honest awareness of what your strengths and areas of development are. If you are not honest or clear about these you will find it difficult to grow because those areas won’t be worked on. Empathy is important because there will be times where things get difficult or you may feel stuck on something, it is best not to be hard on yourself in the process and be accepting of what is happening and use some of the core techniques you are familiar with to help you find a way around it or work through it. All of this is then controlled by your own self awareness, if you are self aware then you can easily identify what you are going through and how to best manage yourself to get the best out of any situation in the learning process or when programming.
                    </p>
                    
                <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Neuroplasticity, that for me was an eye opener, it basically says that you are never too old to learn something new or change the way you are thinking. This is so powerful, as it means you can develop new skills through learning and also unlearn thoughts or habits that no longer serve you.
                    </p>
                
                <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Learning the different ways to think like a programmer. I think the process of developing new skills requires being open to change, and if you are already used to operating in a way that works for you learning how to do something different can be tough on the brain. It may even mean having to let go of old habits or beliefs in order to make way for new ones, and that emotionally can be daunting, but necessary in some cases in order to change.
                    </p>
                
                <h5>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Because understanding yourself in the context of others and utilising these core skills will set you up for a career in the Tech Industry. The common message I am seeing is that most Tech employers aren’t looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They’re looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team.
                    </p>
                <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h5>
                    <p>                    
                        Not at all, I have learnt a lot about myself through the core material and have learnt how to better manage my time when on tasks and when planning the day, how to be present and focused when working on tasks, and also how to manage and be aware of distractions when working. I have also learnt some better ways to problem solve. Without some base or awareness of these topics, it can be easy to fall into an emotional spiral if you can’t manage yourself effectively in tough situations. I find that it has been useful for my learning journey so far, and as result have been able to complete all of the technical tasks more effectively and in a fraction of the time because I am tuned in.
